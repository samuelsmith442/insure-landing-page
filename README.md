- Desktop: `lg:` prefix (1024px and above)

Different background patterns are used for mobile and desktop views to enhance the visual experience on each device.

### Accessibility

- Semantic HTML elements
- Proper alt text for images
- Keyboard navigation support
- Sufficient color contrast
- ARIA attributes where necessary

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14.0.0 or later)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/insure-landing-page.git
   cd insure-landing-page/insure-nextjs
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

### Development

### Building for Production

Build the application for production:

```bash
npm run build
# or
yarn build
```

## Deployment

This project can be easily deployed to platforms like Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub Pages:

### Deploying to Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme).

1. Push your code to a GitHub repository
2. Import your repository to Vercel
3. Vercel will automatically detect Next.js and configure the build settings

### Deploying to Netlify

1. Push your code to a GitHub repository
2. Create a new site on Netlify and connect your repository
3. Configure the build settings:
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Publish directory: `out`
4. Add an environment variable: `NETLIFY_NEXT_PLUGIN_SKIP=true`

## Lessons Learned

- **Responsive Design Challenges**: Creating a design that works seamlessly across different device sizes requires careful planning and implementation.
- **Mobile-First Approach**: Starting with mobile designs and progressively enhancing for larger screens leads to cleaner code.
- **Next.js Image Optimization**: Using the Next.js Image component significantly improves performance by optimizing images.
- **JSX Syntax**: Handling apostrophes in JSX requires special attention to avoid syntax errors.
- **Tailwind Utility Classes**: Leveraging Tailwind's utility classes allows for rapid UI development without writing custom CSS.
